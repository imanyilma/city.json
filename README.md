# city.json
This data on Ethiopian cities and their regions is sourced from http://www.ethiovisit.com/ethiopia/ethiopia-regions-and-cities.html.
It defines a list of cities in Ethiopia with their corresponding regions and language codes. Each city is represented as an object with three main properties:

-name: The city name, provided in either English or Amharic.

-region: The administrative region or zone where the city is located, also given in English or Amharic.

-lang: The language code indicating the language of the city name and region ("en" for English and "am" for Amharic).

The list alternates between English and Amharic entries for the same cities, providing parallel information in both languages
